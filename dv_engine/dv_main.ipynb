Whether you prefer using a YAML file or a Python dictionary, the \"Template-First\" approach ensures that adding 100 new Hubs or Links follows the exact same standardized logic.\n","\n","3. **Simplicity & Visibility**: Using Materialized Lake Views provides a \"setup-once\" architecture that is both performant and transparent. Because MLVs are native to Fabric, they appear automatically in the Lineage View, allowing you to visually trace data flow from your Stage tables all the way to your final consumer views.\n","\n","4. **Configuration-as-Code**: Your entire Data Vault design is portable. You can export your definitions into a YAML file to backup your architecture or import them into a new Fabric Workspace, making it easy to sync environments (Dev/Test/Prod) in seconds.\n","\n","### Example Usage\n","```\n","dv = DataVaultManager(\"ingestion_time\") # Get the default column for ingestion timestamp for downstream timestamping\n","\n","dv.add_hub(Hub(\n","    name=\"hub_quotes\",\n","    schema_name=\"silver\",\n","    business_key_columns=[\"id\"],\n","    source_table=\"cc_fabric_lakehouse_new.bronze.hubspot_quotes\"\n",")).add_hub(Hub(\n","    name=\"hub_deals\",\n","    schema_name=\"silver\",\n","    business_key_columns=[\"deals\"],\n","    load_datetime_column=\"load_ts\"  # override the default timestamp column\n","    source_table=\"cc_fabric_lakehouse_new.bronze.deals\"\n",")).add_link(Link(\n","    name=\"link_quote_deal\",\n","    schema_name=\"silver\",\n","    staging_schema=\"staging\",\n","    anchor=LinkAnchor(\n","        table=\"cc_fabric_lakehouse_new.bronze.hubspot_quotes\",  # Anchor table, the table after a FROM sql statement\n","        hub=\"hub_quotes\",\n","        bk_columns=[\"id\"]\n","    ),\n","    hub_mapping=[\n","        LinkHubJoin(\n","            hub=\"hub_deals\",\n","            table=\"cc_fabric_lakehouse_new.bronze.hubspot_deals\", # Join table, the table after a JOIN sql statement\n","            bk_columns=[\"id\"],\n","            join_on={\"value\": \"id\"} # FK/PK of the Anchor table to FK/PK of the Joining table\n","        )\n","    ]\n",")).add_satellite(Satellite(\n","    name=\"sat_quotes\",\n","    schema_name=\"silver\",\n","    parent_hub_or_link=\"hub_quotes\",\n","    descriptive_columns=['id', 'ingestion_time'],\n","    include_mode=False, # excludes the columns in the descriptive_columns parameter as the descriptive column of the satellite\n","    source_table=\"cc_fabric_lakehouse_new.bronze.hubspot_quotes_v1\"\n","))\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","execute: run the config or not\n","verbose: print the SQL strings generated\n","force: force execute even with warnings\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","dv.construct_vault(execute=True, verbose=True, force=True)\n","dv.export_config('Files/vault_config.yaml') # export the Data Vault config to yaml\n","\n","# import yaml config file and run\n","dv = DataVaultManager.from_config(\"Files/vault_config.yaml\")\n","dv.construct_vault(execute=True, verbose=True, force=True)\n","```\n","\n","\n","### Internal Notebooks\n","- **dv_core**: Dataclasses and Enums\n","- **dv_ddl_generator**: DDL (SQL String) Generation for Stage and Vault Entities\n","- **dv_validator**: Config Parsing validations\n","- **dv_utils**: Import-Export util, etc...\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"64e04dcd-fbf9-4553-95aa-0d87600e1b0c"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run dv_core"],"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"application/vnd.livy.statement-meta+json":{"spark_pool":null,"statement_id":-1,"statement_ids":[],"state":"finished","livy_statement_state":null,"session_id":null,"normalized_state":"finished","queued_time":"2026-01-29T14:29:10.8980085Z","session_start_time":"2026-01-29T14:29:10.8985555Z","execution_start_time":null,"execution_finish_time":"2026-01-29T14:29:11.0581957Z","parent_msg_id":"20e5ef78-83ed-4137-b7d4-32e34ca61f9b"},"text/plain":"StatementMeta(, , -1, Finished, , Finished)"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"error","ename":"InvalidHttpRequestToLivy","evalue":"[TooManyRequestsForCapacity] This spark job can't be run because you have hit a spark compute or API rate limit.
